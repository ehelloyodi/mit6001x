#Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.
#The following variables contain values as described below:
#balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
#annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal
#monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal
#Monthly interest rate= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
#Minimum monthly payment = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)
#Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)
#Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)

#Solution A
for month in range(1, 13): 
        payment = monthlyPaymentRate*balance
        balance = balance - payment + ((balance - payment) * annualInterestRate / 12)
        month += 1
print("Remaining balance: " + str('%.2f' % balance))
